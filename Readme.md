User is not Siggned In, so we are seeing **SignIn** button at top right corner, if suppose user was a authenticated user then it wold display **SignOut** instead.

A random user (not necessarily signed in user) can Search any book by searching its name, author or isbn number, 

Now, let's say user searched for the book named '**Last Wish**'
